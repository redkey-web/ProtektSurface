## Part 4: The Opt-In vs Spam Distinction

### Critical Difference

> "Unlike spam texts, which are unsolicited and often unwanted, text message marketing relies on obtaining explicit consent from users before sending any messages. This permission-based approach ensures that recipients are genuinely interested."
> — [Image Building Media](https://imagebuildingmedia.com/marketing-edu/sms-marketing/why-text-message-marketing-dominating-digital-landscape)

### Consumer Selectivity Shows Trust

- **95%** of consumers subscribe to fewer than 7 brands via SMS
- About **50%** subscribe to only 2-3 brands
- Opt-out rates consistently sit **below 3%**

> "Consumers are pickier about who they give their phone number to... considerably fewer brands than most people give their email to."
> — [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/sms-marketing-report)

### Legal Framework Protects Consumers

In Australia (ACMA Spam Act 2003):
- Explicit consent required before sending
- Must identify business in every message
- Must provide unsubscribe option
- Penalties up to $2.2 million/day for violations

This regulatory framework ensures SMS marketing is permission-based, not spam.

## Part 6: Best Practices to Avoid Negative Impact

### Frequency Guidelines

| Recommendation | Source |
|----------------|--------|
| 2-6 texts per month | [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/sms-marketing-report) |
| 3-4 messages per month | Industry standard |
| Unsubscribe rates spike after 2+ texts in 7 days | [Cartloop](https://www.cartloop.io/post/5-reasons-your-customers-dont-like-text-marketing) |

### Timing

> "Sending text messages at the wrong time annoys customers. A marketing text sent when prospects are sleeping at midnight might make you seem like 'a marketer who doesn't care about their customers.'"
> — [SendHub](https://www.sendhub.com/5-tips-to-never-annoy-your-customers-with-sms-marketing/)

**Optimal timing**: 2pm-4pm, Tuesday-Thursday, weekdays only

### Content Rules

What consumers want:
- Personalized according to past purchases
- Offers related to their interests
- Transactional messages (confirmations, reminders)
- Exclusive deals not available elsewhere

What consumers hate:
- Generic blast messages
- Repetitive offers
- Content they could get via email
- Low-value "sales" notifications

2. **One message per customer journey** — Not multiple marketing touches
3. **Keep it service-focused** — "Your appointment is tomorrow at 10am" not "20% off this week!"
